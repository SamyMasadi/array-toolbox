# Array Toolbox
The program is an Array Toolbox containing several methods towards creating and modifying one dimension and two dimension arrays.

## Required Software
* To run: [Java version 8 or higher](https://www.java.com/en/download/)
* To compile: [Java SE Development Kit](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)

## How to Compile
In a terminal, cd to the "src" directory. Compile each .java file like the following example:
```
javac ArrayToolbox.java
```

## How to Run
In a terminal, cd to the "bin" directory (or the directory containing compiled .class files). Enter the following to start the program:
```
java ArrayToolbox
```

## Using the Array Toolbox
Step 1: Enter the number that corresponds to your choice.
```
1. Create new 1D array
2. Create new 2D array
3. Select saved 1D array
4. Select saved 2D array
5. Exit Program
```
Step 2: To create an array, enter the number corresponding to one of the following:
```
Initialize array:
1. by specified length
2. by inputing values
```
Step 3: The next submenu will display options for the current array. Enter a number corresponding to your choice.

For 1D Arrays:
```
1. Double array's length
2. Add two arrays of the same size
3. Subtract two arrays of the same size
4. Calculate the sum of all elements
5. Find maximum, minimum, and average
6. Find a specific element
7. Insert an element at specific index location
8. Remove an element from a specific index location
9. Sort the array (ascending order)
10. View array elements
11. Save array
M. Main menu
```

For 2D Arrays:
```
1. Add two arrays of the same size
2. Subtract two arrays of the same size
3. Calculate the sum of all elements
4. Find the maximum, minimum, and average
5. Find specific element
6. Sort the array (ascending order)
7. View array elements
8. Save array
M. Main menu
```
